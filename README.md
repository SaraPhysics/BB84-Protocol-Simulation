# Quantum-Cryptography

Here is a simulation of the BB84 protocol, a proven secure method of Quantum Key Distribution which uses the fundamental aspects of Quantum Mechanics, such as the collapse of the quantum state after measuring it or the No-Cloning Theorem. This was part of my Physics degree's final project. 
This protocol consists of the necessity of two friends (Alice and Bob) of exchanging a key in a safety way. There are two different scripts: one simulating the ideal protocol and another one simulating the presence of an spy (Eve).
